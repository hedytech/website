          Kotlin is the modern language to be aware of, it’s rapidly growing and constantly

          This course will attempt to show you why.</p>
          <p className="abouttextthinleft">
          Kotlin is one of the fastest growing programming languages in the world.
          It’s ability to seamlessly co-exist with Java makes it compatible with probably
          the biggest code base available as well. In fact, one of the purposes of Kotlin was to build a better Java.</p>
          <p className="abouttextthinleft">
          So you have a modern language that is easy to learn, concise, expressive, statically typed,

          <p className="abouttextthinleft">
          Every Android developer how isn’t already on the train thinks about how it will affect them.

          familiar environment. </p>
          <p className="abouttextthinleft">
          Last but not least, the IDEs is created by the same company as the language.
