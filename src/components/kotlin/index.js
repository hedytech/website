          Kotlin is the modern language to be aware of, it’s rapidly growing and constantly

          Kotlin is one of the fastest growing programming languages in the world.
          It’s ability to seamlessly co-exist with Java makes it compatible with probably
          the biggest code base available as well. In fact, one of the purposes of Kotlin was to build a better Java.</p>
